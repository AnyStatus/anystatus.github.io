Microsoft Azure DevOps is a great service, we use it to run our own CI/CD pipeline in the cloud. From building the app to testing it on virtual machines, code singing installers, publishing artifacts and more. It's an awesome service.

The [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) extension pack for AnyStatus lets you view the status and progress of your builds, releases, deployment environments and work-items in AnyStatus from your desktop.

AnyStatus continuously monitor Azure DevOps in the back-end of your development workflow. When you need it, usually after committing your work, you get a quick view of your entire CI/CD pipeline to make sure your work is delivered safely.

Viewing the entire stack in a single dashboard saves time. Instead of looking around web pages for statuses and information AnyStatus gives you all of the information you need in one place on your desktop to give you a clear picture of your development process.
