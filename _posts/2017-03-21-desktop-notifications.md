Latest release of AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio includes a new feature that shows desktop motifications when the status of your CI Builds or other monitors change.

Notifications are enabled by default and can be globally disabled in the Options page.

You can also disable notifications for specific monitors in the monitor properties page.

When working with multiple instances of Visual Studio, only one of them will publish notifications. When that instance is closed, another instance will take control and start publishing notifications.
