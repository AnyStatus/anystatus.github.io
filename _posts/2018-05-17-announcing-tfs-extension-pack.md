I'm pleased to announce the initial release of the new TFS Extension Pack for AnyStatus which is now available at the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anystatus.TFSExtensionPack).

This is an early release which requires [AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlonAmsalem.AnyStatus) version 2.1 or above to be installed.

The new extension pack includes advanced widgets for remote controlling builds, releases (deployments) and work items on TFS and VSTS.

The extension pack is free for the beta period. After that, a perpetual license will be required.

Hopefully, additional extension packs for Jenkins, SonarQube, Octopus Deploy and other tools will be developed further down the road.

**Please note** TFS extension pack is a work in progress. If you experience any issues or would like to suggest changes, please create a new [issue](https://github.com/AnyStatus/Support/issues) on GitHub.

**Also note** Currently, to open an AnyStatus settings file that contains references to the widgets of the TFS Extension Pack, the extension must be installed.
Otherwise, the settings file will fail to load.

If you have any requests or questions, please let me know in the comments section below or via the [support channels](/support).

Thank you for using AnyStatus!
