I'm pleased to announce the availability of AnyStatus 3 Preview 1 for download on [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/anystatus/9p044vpk62sb). The new version includes various key new features, bugs fixes, and improvements. For a detailed list of all changes, please refer to the [Release Notes](/docs/release-notes).

### Release Highlights

##### Endpoints

Endpoints is a new feature that helps users maintain their accounts and connections to their servers more easily. Endpoints can be shared across multiple widgets and configurations. Example include, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Docker, NuGet, SQL Server and more.

##### New User Interface

The AnyStatus user interface has been revamped to provide an easy-to-use interface that boosts user experience. It includes almost all functions available in previous versions plus a number of new features and enhancements. Its highly improved performance allows tens and hundreds of Widgets to connect simultaneously. Intuitive dashboards and windows with in-line help guide users in their daily work.

##### Newly Improved API SDK

A new and improved API SDK has been introduced in this release. The new API SDK provides a fine-grained control over the features and behaviors of the Widgets.

##### Better Context Menu

I have significantly improved the dashboard context menu experience. The new context menu shows only options that are supported by the selected widget. For example, widgets that are automatically created will not be allowed to be deleted unless it is supported by the widget.
