Over the past year, I've made several changes to the user interface that makes AnyStatus easier to use and more intuitive.
This time I've changed the upper toolbar and added a new navigation menu that replaces the three dots button and the context menu in previous versions.

The left menu is opened by clicking the hamburger button on the upper left corner. As you can see, the Settings (previously Options) and Activity Log buttons were moved into the left menu to save space on the toolbar.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/anystatus-2.4.46-azure-devops.png"/></div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/anystatus-2.4.46-azure-devops-left-menu.png"/></div>
</div>

The new user interface is available in the beta release (unstable) until it is ready to be shipped.
You can find the installer on our [downloads](/downloads) page. Go ahead, give it a try and let us know what you think.

We're always looking for ways to improve AnyStatus. Please leave a comment below on whether you liked the new user interface or not and what would you like to improve. Thanks!
