New in AnyStatus Desktop 1.5.12! You can now dock the dashboard window to the side of your primary or secondary screen. The dashboard will automatically hide when losing focus. To bring back the dashboard window, click on the AnyStatus icon in your taskbar notification area.

Any feedback or comments on the new feature is highly appreciated.
