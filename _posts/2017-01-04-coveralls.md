AnyStatus now supports [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to help you track code coverage over time, and ensure that all your code is fully covered.

The Coveralls monitor shows the percentage of covered code and lets you specify the minimum acceptable code coverage which will fail the monitor once the threshold has been reached.

You can also right-click the Coveralls monitor and choose *Open in Browser* in the context menu to open Coveralls repository page in browser.
