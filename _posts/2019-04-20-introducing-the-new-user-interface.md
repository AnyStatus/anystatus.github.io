Over the past year, I've made several changes to the user interface to make AnyStatus easier to use and more intuitive.
I am continuously looking for ways to improve and fine-tune AnyStatus user interface, based on my personal experience at work and mostly your feedback.

In this release, I have re-designed the main menu and added a new navigation menu to the left side of the window. The new layout replaces the three-dots button and the context menu that appeared in previous versions.

The left menu is opened by clicking the hamburger button at the upper left corner.
As you can see, the Options (now Settings) and the Activity Log buttons moved to the left menu.
In this layout, the most frequent buttons are accessible from the toolbar and the rest from the left menu.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/anystatus-2.4.46-azure-devops.png"/></div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><img src="/assets/images/screenshots/anystatus-2.4.46-azure-devops-left-menu.png"/></div>
</div>

The new user interface preview is available in the beta release (a.k.a., unstable) until it is ready to ship.
You can download the beta version from our [Downloads](/downloads) page. Go ahead, give it a try and let us know what you think.

Please leave a comment below whether you like the new user interface or not and suggest new ways to improve.

Enjoy
