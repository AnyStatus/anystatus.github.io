You can now view the status of your [Uptime Robot](http://uptimerobot.com/) monitors in Visual Studio using AnyStatus extension.

The Uptime Robot monitor enables you to view the status of a single monitor or all monitors in your Uptime Robot account.

In order to use the Uptime Robot monitor, get your Uptime Robot API Key from the **My Settings** page at [Uptime Robot](http://uptimerobot.com/) website.

**Tip:** To view the overall status of all monitors in your account, leave the Monitor Name empty.
