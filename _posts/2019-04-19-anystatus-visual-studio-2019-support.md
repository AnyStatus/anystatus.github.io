AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio version 2.4.25 has been released a few weeks ago to support the new Visual Studio 2019 release. Thankfully, the upgrade was much easier than last year when I added support for Visual Studio 2017. Thanks to the Visual Studio Team and Mads Kristensen for his post on [how to upgrade extensions to support Visual Studio 2019](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-to-upgrade-extensions-to-support-visual-studio-2019/), the upgrade was quick and easy. In addition, AnyStatus now supports Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019 and will no longer support Visual Studio 2012/2013.

The new release was tested thoroughly using Visual Studio 2019 Preview and it worked well. If you experience any issues running AnyStatus on Visual Studio 2019, please share your insights using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AnyStatus/Support/issues) or [Support Portal](https://anystatus.helprace.com/s1-general/problems) or the comments section below.
