You can now view the status of your Pingdom Checks using AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio.

The Pingdom monitor enables you to view the status of a single Pingdom Check or the overall status of all checks in your Pingdom account.

**TIP:** To view the overall status of all your Pingdom checks, leave the *Check Id* empty.
