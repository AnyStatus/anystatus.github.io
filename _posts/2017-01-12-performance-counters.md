On Windows operating systems, performance counters provide information about the health of the operating system, applications, services and other components. The counter data can help determine system bottlenecks and enable you to fine-tune system and application performance.

You can now monitor performance counters on a local or remote machine using AnyStatus. At this point, the monitor only shows the value of the performance counter and the status of the monitor is always OK unless there's an error collecting the performance counter.

Adding a new Performance Counter monitor is easy, simply add a New Item and select Performance Counter in the list.
Note, the *Instance* and *Machine Name* fields are optional. Leave the *Machine Name* empty for local computer.
