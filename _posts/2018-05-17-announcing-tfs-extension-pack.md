I'm pleased to announce the initial release of **AnyStatus - TFS Extension Pack**, now available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anystatus.TFSExtensionPack).

This is an early release which requires [AnyStatus extension for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlonAmsalem.AnyStatus) version 2.1 or above to be installed.

The new extension pack installs additional premium widgets in AnyStatus, for TFS and VSTS builds, releases and work items.

The extension pack is free for the beta period until September 1, 2018. After that, a perpetual license will be required.

**Please note** TFS extension pack is a work in progress, the actions have not been implemented yet, only basic functionality at this point. If you experience any issues or would like to suggest changes, please [contact us](/support).

**Also note** to open a settings file that contains a reference to the widgets in the TFS Extension Pack, the TFS Extension Pack must be installed. Otherwise, the settings file will not load.
